### Introduction
Getting ready for job interviews can be a nerve-wracking experience, especially when you lack first-hand knowledge of a particular company's interview process. Insights aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform where students and job seekers can share their interview experiences, including the questions asked, the interview format, and tips for acing the interview. It is a community-driven initiative to empower each other in the pursuit of professional success.

### Frontend
The frontend of Insights is built using modern web technologies and frameworks like React. I used responsive design principles to ensure that the website works seamlessly across different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The intuitive user interface makes it easy to navigate through interview experiences and find the information you need. Currently, this project is a frontend only project.

### How it Works
Insights is straightforward to use:

1. Search for a Company: Enter the name of the company you are interested in or about to interview with, and our platform will show you a list of interview experiences shared by other users.

2. Share Your Experience: If you've recently gone through an interview, we encourage you to share your experience to help others. You can add details such as the interview rounds, questions asked, and any advice you may have for future candidates.

3. Read and Learn: Gain valuable insights into the interview process, company culture, and hiring trends by reading experiences shared by others. Learn from their successes and challenges to be better prepared for your interview.
